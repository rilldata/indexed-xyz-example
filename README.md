# Welcome to the Rill Indexed.xyz Art Blocks example Repo

This repository is an example for the Indexed.xyz and Rill Data project for Art Blocks. You can read more at our [blog](https://docs.rilldata.com/indexed-xyz) post.

## Getting started
Make sure that you have installed Rill Developer.

```
curl -s https://cdn.rilldata.com/install.sh | bash

```
For more information, see [docs.rilldata.com](https://docs.rilldata.com).


Run the following commands to clone the repository and start Rill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rilldata/indexed-xyz-example.git
cd indexed-xyz-example
rill start
```

The initial call to `rill start` may take a while depending on your network connection as it downloads some large remote parquet files.
